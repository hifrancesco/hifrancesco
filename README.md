My name is Franky and today is Monday, 10 April at 07:21 BST. 

I work at KPMG. I work as a DevOps Engineer in the engineering team.

My tech stack are aws, python, github, linux, terraform. Some of my hobbies are chess and football.

I am currently working on a github actions project.

Something that I want to get better at is: <img alt="Python" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-2360ee?style=flat-square&logo=python&logoColor=yellow" />
